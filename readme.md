# Renderware IO
This project is a library to read and write asset files for renderware games. Specifically GTA San Andreas.  

The library is incomplete, and should be considered experimental.

The `ConsoleApplication` project contains some examples on how to use the library, note that no .dff, .col, .txd or .img included in the repo for these tests.
